2. A novel diagnostic approach for the classification of small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms based on the NanoString platform
(Submitter supplied) Small B-cell lymphoid neoplasms (SBCLNs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by malignant clonal proliferation of mature B-cells. However, the classification of SBCLNs remains a challenge, especially in cases where histopathological analysis is unavailable or those with atypical laboratory findings or equivocal pathologic data. In this study, gene expression profiling of 1,039 samples from 27 GEO datasets was first investigated to select highly and differentially expressed genes among SBCLNs. more...

(Submitter supplied) Lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and marginal zone lymphomas of nodal, extra-nodal and splenic types account for 10% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.  They are similar at the cell differentiation level, sometimes making difficult to distinguish them from other indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas.  To better characterize their genetic basis, we performed array-based comparative genomic hybridization in 101 marginal zone lymphomas (46 MALT, 35 splenic and 20 nodal marginal zone lymphomas) and 13 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. more...

(Submitter supplied) Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZL) are an uncommon type of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL-B) in which no specific chromosomal translocations have been described. In contrast, the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality is the loss of the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q). Previous reports have located this loss in the 7q32 region. In order to better characterize the genomic imbalances in SMZL, molecular studies were carried out in 73 patients with SMZL. more...

17. CGH profiling of 87 indolent non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Low-grade B-cell lymphomas include several subtypes of tumors with different degrees of histological, biological or clinical features. Differential diagnosis is frequently compromised by the lack of specific cytogenetic or molecular features. As a consequence, therapies remain in many lymphoma types largely based in common protocols with largely variable success. Our objectives were to describe and to compare the genomic profile of a series of samples from the most prevalent low-grade lymphoma subtypes; all of them systematically analyzed with the same approach. more...

Notably, deletion or uniparental disomy of chromosome 7q were detected in 39% of SMZLs but in only 9 of 170 (5%) mature B-cell lymphomas (p<10-6). The presence of unmutated IgVH genes, genomic complexity, 17p13-P53 deletion and 8q gain including MYC gene, but not 7q deletion, were correlated with shorter overall survival. more...

19. An integrated genomic and expression analysis of 7q deletion in splenic marginal zone lymphoma (Main Study)
(Submitter supplied) Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by 7q32 deletion, but the target genes of this deletion remain unknown.  In order to elucidate the genetic target of this deletion, we performed an integrative analysis of the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and miRNomic data.  High resolution array comparative genomic hybridization of 56 cases of SMZL delineated a minimally deleted region (2.8Mb) at 7q32, but showed no evidence of any cryptic homozygous deletion or recurrent breakpoint in this region. more...

Overall survival of SMZL is estimated to reach 8 to 11 years in most cases, but up to 30% of SMZL cases develop aggressive presentations resulting in greatly diminished time of survival. SMZL presents with a very heterogeneous molecular profile, making diagnosis problematic and accurate prognosis even less likely. more...

Dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies (registered as NCT03547115). more...

Around 5-10% of SjS patients develop B-cell lymphoma, usually extranodal marginal zone lymphomas (eMZL) of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

Epigenetically-mediated NKX2-3 over-expression was selectively found in patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphoma, MALT lymphoma and extranodal diffuse large-cell lymphoma. In young mice, restricted expression of NKX2-3 to lymphocytes activated multiple integrins (LFA-1, VLA-4, MAC-1), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, MadCAM-1, L-selectin) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that enhanced their homing and migration to splenic tissues, whereby they were retained, progressively accumulating to form non-clonal tumors. more...

In the present investigation we used two-stage long-term bone marrow cultures to detect functional stromal cell abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. While fibroblasts from multiple myeloma and macrophages from multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes were functionally indistinguishable from the respective cell types from normal bone marrow, fibroblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes possessed a significantly lower ability to support hematopoiesis originating from co-cultured normal CD34-positive cells than fibroblasts from healthy marrow. more...

In the present study, we evaluated 36 sMZL spleen specimens by single cell analysis to gain a better understanding of the TME in sMZL. Using mass cytometry (CyTOF), we observed that the TME in sMZL is distinct from that of control non-malignant reactive spleen (rSP). We found that the number of TFH cells varied greatly in sMZL, ICOS+ TFH cells were more abundant in sMZL than rSP, and TFH cells positively correlated with increased numbers of memory B cells. more...

Patients are predominantly young males presenting with localized disease. The tumor shows overlapping morphological features with pediatric-type follicular lympgoma. The  alterations involved in the pathogenesis of PNMZL are not known.

71. A single cell RNA-Seq study of splenic marginal zone lymphomas (SMZL)
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Single cell RNA-Seq was used to characterize in depth splenic samples obtained from splenic marginal zone lymphomas Methods: 3 frozen samples of spleen from SMZL patients were selected and thawed for performing a 10X genomics single cell RNA-Sequencing 3' assay. Results: Tumor cells formed mainly patient specific-B cell  clusters, while  T-cells from the 3 patients clustered together. Conclusion: Single RNA-Seq unveils the cellular composition of  splenic tumors from SMZL patients.

72. Expression profiling by array in the splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)
(Submitter supplied) The transformation mechanism into a high-grade malignancy of SMZL has not been well studied. To define and compare the differentially expressed genes between primary SMZL cells at the different clinical periods, we analyzed the gene expression profiles using the CodeLink Human Whole Genome Bioarray.

73. Deregulated expression of HDAC9 in B cells promotes development of lymphoproliferative disease and lymphoma in mice [Bcell subsets]
(Submitter supplied) Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) is expressed in B cells, and its overexpression has been observed in B-lymphoproliferative disorders, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). We examined HDAC9 protein expression and copy number alterations in primary B-NHL samples, identifying high HDAC9 expression among various lymphoma entities and HDAC9 copy number gains in 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). more...
